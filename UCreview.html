    <h3> That one guy </h3>
    <p> (Geotagged from <i> The Moon </i>) <i> The Milky Way Cafe </i> had great food, friendly staff and a very nice atmosphere. I'd reccomend it to anyone who lives nearby. </p>

    <p> So I ordered, said it would deliver "as quickly as possible", and it took three days for my food to get here. 0/10, no stars, never eating here again.  </p>
