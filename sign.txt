Head:
A dark blue div that spans the width of the screen with the title and assorted subtitles with some stars and that picture I found but squished
I'll download the fonts on my laptop and then put them in over the weekend
Underneath the header are divs for each main page which light up when you roll over them with the mouse.
Pages:
  Home:
    There's a header and a paragraph talking about the cafe and how it was created by two astronauts who got stranded on the moon and were bored. It also talks about how the entire building is made of
    moon rocks and also how the food is teleported from earth with technology created by the one person who actually lives on the moon and is the only physical visitor to the cafe. This is in a div,
    there's also a composite picture of various dishes sold at the cafe. On side is the phone number (000-000-0000) and e-mail (spacepunsaredumb@gmail.com)
